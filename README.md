## Installation

Just copy the presets into the guitarix config folder (*~/.config/guitarix/banks/*) and restart it. No additional actions needed.



## Presets Description

The presets are created for home usage with the notebook and the common speakers or headphones.

The collection includes:



### Fender '65 Deluxe Reverb

Bright vintage sound with reverb and tremolo. Nice choice for old school rock/metal music, blues, country and experiments with echoes.

The Deluxe Reverb has no effects loops, so the pedals are plugged before the amp. It's not a mistake. We use the CryBaby (auto), the Tone Screamer and the Digital Delay and this pedalboard remains unchanged in different presets to make the switches between them more realistic.

List of the presets in this bank:

1. Clean
2. Clean (Short Reverb)
3. Clean (Delay)
4. Clean (Tremolo)
5. Crunch (Cry Baby)
6. Overdrive
7. Overdrive (Short Reverb)
8. Overdrive (Delay)

*Tip: It's a good idea to experiment with volume and tone on your guitar when playing using the "overdrive" presets. No hi-gain here, so we can achieve really different sounds without changing the preset settings.*

More combos and presets will be added soon...



## Troubleshooting

### A lot of distortion everythere

These presets were created for low cost configuration when the guitar is plugged right into the combo jack of the notebook. No additional sound cards or preamps were used. If you use some preamps, you have to reduce its output volume to remove a distortion.

### It sounds too quiet on recording

You can add the Buffer Booster at the end of the preset, before the recorder. It'll not change the tone, but the resulting sound will be much louder.
